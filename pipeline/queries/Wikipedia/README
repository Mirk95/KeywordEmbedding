Each numbered file in this directory contains the relevance assessments for the topic corresponding to the file name. Each file has the following structure:
# <query>
<relevant result>
<relevant result>
...
Hash marks ('#') denote comments and should be ignored. (Most comments relate additional information about a particular result judged relevant or clarification about the topic.) Each relevant result has the following structure:
([<comma-separated list of tuples>], [<comma-separated list of relationships between tuples>])
Tuples are identified by their *unique* __search_id in the database. Each relationship is an edge (foreign key) between tuples, labeled by the source and destination of the edge.
