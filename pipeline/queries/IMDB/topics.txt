1-10: America's favorite movie stars (http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/pubs/Harris_Poll_2009_01_29.pdf)
Relevant results contain a single tuple from the person relation that is the tuple of the specified individual.

11-20: America's favorite movies (http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?pid=874)
Relevant results contain a single tuple from the title relation that is the tuple of the specified film. Exception is made for topics 12 and 14, which are well-known trilogies (i.e., all films of the trilogy are deemed relevant).

21-30: film characters (http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246)
Relevant results contain 3 tuples (1 from the char_name relation, 1 from the cast_info relation, and 1 from the title relation) that link the character to the film(s) in which s/he appears. (The keyword 'title' is intentionally added to differentiate this group of topics from topics 1-20.)

31-35: film quotes (http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/quotes100.pdf?docID=242)
Relevant results contain 2 tuples (1 from the movie_info relation and 1 from the title relation) that link the movie quote to the film in which it appears. (The keyword 'title' is intentionally added so that relevant results answer the question "In which film does this quote appear?".) Note that a quote may appear in multiple films -- AFI's list is the standard for judging relevance.

36: 
Relevant results must denote the films in which the actor Mark Hamill plays the character Luke Skywalker. Note that because of limitations of existing systems, relevant results are *not* required to include a tuple from the title relation (which would prevent any system from identifying a single relevant result).

37:

38:
Relevant results must denote the character that Henry Fonda plays in the film "Yours, Mine, and Ours." Note that because of limitations of existing systems, relevant results are *not* required to include the appropriate tuple from the char_name relation (which would prevent any system from identifying a single relevant result).

39:
Relevant results must denote the character that Russell Crowe plays in the film "Gladiator." Note that because of limitations of existing systems, relevant results are *not* required to include the appropriate tuple from the char_name relation (which would prevent any system from identifying a single relevant result).

40:

Note that because of limitations of existing systems, relevant results are *not* required to include a tuple from the char_name relation (which would prevent any system from identifying a single relevant result).

44:
Relevant results must denote a film in which Sylvester Stallone plays the character Rocky. Note that because of limitations of existing systems, relevant results are *not* required to include the appropriate tuple from the title relation (which would prevent any system from identifying a single relevant result).
