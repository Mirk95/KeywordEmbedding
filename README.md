At the beginning of our work we start studying the main word embedding techniques known in the Literature and understanding how to use them for structured data taken from databases.
Analyzing the various approaches proposed by numerous data scientists from all over the world, we focused our attention on two frameworks:
* [EmbDI](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/cappuzzo/embdi)
>EmbDI is a Python library developed to perform Entity Resolution (ER) and Schema Matching (SM) tasks by employing
word embeddings.

* [RETRO](https://github.com/guenthermi/postgres-retrofit)
>RETRO is a framework that provides tools to automatically extract text values from a PostgreSQL database, represent those text values by a continuous vector representation using a word embedding model. In order to incorporate semantic knowledge from the database into the representation, it extracts additional relational information from the database and uses this knowledge to refine the embeddings by a relational retrofitting method. The resulting embeddings can then be used to perform machine learning tasks.
